> “By nature men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart.” — Confucius

> “The content of your character is your choice. Day by day, what you choose, what you think and what you do is who you become” — Heraclitus

> “Habit is either the best of servants or the worst of masters.” — Nathanael Emmons
