Really great plugin if you are newer in IntelliJ

https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x

It helps you towars [[_.th.tech.Banish the Mouse]], and use your a keyboard to do exactly what you want to do instead of roaming around the menus. 

At the time of this writing I don't have it installed anymore, although I probably should since I switched to the new keyboard recently [[_.health.programming.keyboard.lily58]] and started to use the mouse at times due to not being used to the keyboard yet.
