If you are too tired there is no point pushing further. 

Being too tired is very subjective. Sometimes you will be able to go 12 hours and feel fine. Other times 8 hour day will wear you out. 



- [[rel.instead]]:**[[_.get-good-sleep]]**

Work in [[_.state.flow-work-state]], when you too tired this isn't flow state. 

------------------------------------------------------

Note: On **rare occasion** it makes sense to make an exception and push through tiredness and work through it. However, this must be rare exception rather than a rule. Such push must be seen as a mistake that needs evaluated in retrospective and accounted for remedied in the future.
