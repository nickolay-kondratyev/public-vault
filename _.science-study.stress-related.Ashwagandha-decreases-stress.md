> The treatment group that was given the high-concentration full-spectrum Ashwagandha root extract exhibited a significant reduction (P<0.0001) in scores on all the stress-assessment scales on Day 60, relative to the placebo group. **The serum cortisol levels were substantially reduced** (P=0.0006) in the Ashwagandha group, relative to the placebo group. The adverse effects were mild in nature and were comparable in both the groups. No serious adverse events were reported. - [Study results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/)
