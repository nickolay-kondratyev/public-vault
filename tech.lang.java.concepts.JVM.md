> JVM is the heart of Java programming language. When we execute a Java program, JVM is responsible for converting the byte code to the machine-specific code. JVM is also platform-dependent and provides core java functions such as memory management, garbage collection, security, etc. JVM is customizable and we can use java options to customize it. For example, allocating minimum and maximum memory to JVM. JVM is called virtual because it provides an interface that does not depend on the underlying operating system and machine hardware. This independence from hardware and the operating system makes java program write-once-run-anywhere.
