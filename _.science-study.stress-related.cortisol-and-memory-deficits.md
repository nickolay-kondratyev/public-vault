> Elevated [[_.body-chemical.glucocorticoid]] levels produce hippocampal dysfunction and correlate with individual deficits in spatial learning in aged rats. Previously we related persistent [[_.body-chemical.cortisol]] increases to memory impairments in elderly humans studied over five years. Here we demonstrate that aged humans with significant prolonged cortisol elevations showed reduced hippocampal volume and deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks compared to normal-cortisol controls. Moreover, the degree of hippocampal atrophy correlated strongly with both the degree of cortisol elevation over time and current basal cortisol levels. Therefore, basal cortisol elevation may cause hippocampal damage and impair hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in humans.  - [abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10195112/)
