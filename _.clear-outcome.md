Get really clear about what you want and [[why|_.start-with-the-why]] you want it.
Be specific. Use SEE, FEEL, HEAR terms.


Outcome specification is not amorphous I want X amount of money. 

Instead, Outcome is in terms of what:
- You see
- You hear
- You feel


- What do you see?
- What do you hear?
- How do you feel?
