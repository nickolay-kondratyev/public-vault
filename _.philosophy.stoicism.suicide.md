<summary>You have a choice whether to stay or to leave from life</summary>

> Do not believe your situation is genuinely bad-none can make you do that. Is there smoke in the house? If it is not suffocating, I will stay indoors; if it proves too much, I’ll leave. Always remember-the door is open. - [[p.Epictetus]]
