[Alan Watts - Choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7CH9cRN8Rg)

You do not know where your decisions come from. They pop up like hiccups.
...
Did I take enough data into consideration. And if you think it through, you never could take enough data into consideration.
...
The data for any decision is infinite.
...
But worriers are people, who think of all the variables beyond their control and what might happen.
