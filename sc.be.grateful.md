**Be Grateful: Want what you already have.**

Ask: `What qualities of yourself are you grateful for?` And those qualities will grow. 

> Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you. — [[p.Lao-Tzu]]

> “The ability to be content and at peace, by yourself, is freedom.” — [[p.naval]]

> “Content makes poor men rich. Discontent makes rich men poor.” — [[p.Benjamin-Franklin]]

> A rock thrown in the air. It loses nothing by coming down, gained nothing by going up. — [[p.Marcus-Aurelius]]

> To reiterate what I’ve said elsewhere in this book, type-A personalities have goal pursuit as default hardwiring. This is excellent for producing achievement, but also anxiety, as you’re constantly future-focused. I’ve personally decided that achievement is no more than a passing grade in life. It’s a C+ that gets you limping along to the next grade. For anything more, and certainly for anything approaching [[_.happiness]], you have to want what you already have. — [[p.tim-ferris]] [[_.book.Tools-Of-Titans]] (pg. 602)

> Treat what you don’t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have, the things you value most, and think of how much you’d crave them if you didn’t have them. But be careful. Don’t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them — [[p.Marcus-Aurelius]]

> Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants. — [[p.Epictetus]]

> Having the fewest wants, I am nearest to the gods. — [[p.Socrates]]
