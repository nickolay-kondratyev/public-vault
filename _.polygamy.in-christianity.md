> Now in those days Israel had no king. There was a man from the tribe of Levi living in a remote area of the hill country of Ephraim. One day he brought home a woman from Bethlehem in Judah to be his concubine. 2But she became angry with him and returned to her fatherâ€™s home in Bethlehem.  - [link](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JDG.19.NLT)
