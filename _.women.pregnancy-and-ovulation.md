<summary>ChatGPT check: Generally True but with some variance</summary>

Yes, it's generally true. A woman's fertile window is typically a few days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation itself. Sperm can live inside the female reproductive tract for up to 5 days. Therefore, if a woman has sexual intercourse in the days leading up to ovulation, the sperm can survive and potentially fertilize an egg when she ovulates. The day of ovulation is also considered a fertile day. So, in total, the fertile window is often considered to be about 6 days: the 5 days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation itself.

However, it's important to note that the exact duration of the fertile window can vary among women and even from one cycle to another. Some factors, such as the lifespan of the sperm and the egg, can influence the length of the fertile window.

TLDR: Women are typically fertile for about 6 days each month: 5 days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation itself. However, individual variations can occur. #chatgpt4
