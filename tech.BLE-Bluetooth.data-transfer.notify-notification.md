- **Notify/Notifications**: 
  - The [[tech.BLE-Bluetooth.peripheral]] (wearable) will inform the central (e.g., a smartphone) of changes to a characteristic value without:
    - without the central specifically requesting it each time.
    - without needing an acknowledgment from central that it was received.


See [[tech.BLE-Bluetooth.data-transfer.indication]] for when acknowledgements are needed.
