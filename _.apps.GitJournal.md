## Quick look around notes on GitJournal:
- Quite smooth integration with GitLab.
- Quite poor user experience with notes.

## The search didn't prioritize titles of notes 
The note I was looking for is named `[_.body-chemical.dopamine]` these are the results I got when I was looking for it. 

The app didn't appear to give any priority to the fact that the note file name reflected exact search I was looking for and put the note that I wanted as ~5th result.

## The opening of a link from a note was very slow
I thought the app has stopped working but after waiting about ~10seconds I was able to open a another note from the link. (I wonder whether its because I have over ~1000 notes)

It was stuck in this weird state for about ~10 seconds while trying to open the note:

## The images do not render

The note that is being rendered in above example is [[_.body-chemical.dopamine]] (which contains images)
