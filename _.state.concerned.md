If you are concerned about something [[sc.do.laser-focus-on-what-you-control]], on variables that are under control and take action to remedy the concern. 

Sometimes something is out of your hands then focus on making your inner state into state. (Can refer to [[_.state.stress.combatting-it]])

## On Relationship to Worried:
Being concerned about something is much better than being [[worried|_.worry]] about it.

Our societies typical vocabulary of concerned is more geared to actually taking some action. Hence, concerned is much more productive state to be in.
