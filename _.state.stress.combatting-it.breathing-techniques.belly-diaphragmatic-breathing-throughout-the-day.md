## Study
Here is a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5455070/) that examined Belly Breathing. Which stated:

> There was a significant interaction effect of group and time in the diaphragmatic breathing condition on cortisol levels, whereby the BIG [Belly Breather Group] had a significantly lower cortisol level after training - [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5455070/)

> In the diaphragmatic breathing condition, there was a significant interaction effect of group by time on sustained attention, whereby the BIG showed significantly increased sustained attention after training, compared to baseline. - [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5455070/)

<summary>Product Idea: Diaphragmatic/Belly Breathing Tracker</summary>

The above study makes you question why isn't there a device that would encourage correct belly breathing. 

A possible implementation would be the usage of piezoresistive fabric, worn as a wearable around the belly that would allow to give fairly accurate assessment of the whether the customer is correctly breathing or not.
