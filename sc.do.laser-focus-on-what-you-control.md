If we allow ourselves to focus on variables outside of our control, we take the focus from things we can change. Let me repeat. When you think about things outside of your control, you take *resources* away from things that can make your life better. You have a **[[finite amount of time|_.basic-truth.we-have-a-finite-amount-of-time]]** and if you focus on that you cannot change, you steal time away from actions that bring change to your life.

Hence, focus on what you can control. Think about what you can control. Laser focus on variables under your control. Focus on your actions, focus on your inputs into this life, and take the outputs to re-evaluate your input actions.
 
## Control Type of Information Intake
It becomes easier to focus on things that are under our control when we have good inputs of information coming our way. When we intake [[_.information.ira-important-relevant-actionable]], most importantly **actionable**, then our mind tends to gravitate towards thoughts that are also **actionable**.

## Remember: Do **not** worry
Remember: If you can do something about a situation, then **do not worry about it**. Instead, go and enact change. If you cannot do anything, then **do not worry about it**. Instead, find something that you can change.

## Quotes
> “The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own” - [[p.Epictetus]] 

> “First understand the do-or-die importance of focus. If you don’t learn to focus, you will have a shallow and unrewarding life without any meaningful achievements. So make it a priority.” — [[p.Derek-Sivers]]

## Corollary
Corollary: [[sc.do.cultivate-indifference-to-what-is-outside-your-control]]. To laser focus on what is inside of our control we must cultivate ignorance (ignore) things that our outside of our control. 

## If you focus on what you control 
You train to be in the mindset of doing. The lens you look at the world focuses on things that you can change. And hence your perception of the world becomes that the world (your world) is changing and you see yourself as being able to influence the change. 

## Focus on your inputs

## Also note
Before laser focusing on something: make sure to have [[_.clear-goals]].
