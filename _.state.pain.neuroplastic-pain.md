> One of the most important pain studies of the last few years actually captured this process in action. Researchers followed people who had recently injured their backs. At first, their pain was active in the normal pain regions of the brain. But when the pain became chronic, it shifted to parts of the brain associated with learning and memory. Neuroplastic pain is a fundamentally different kind of pain. Itâ€™s pain that has gotten stuck because your brain has learned it too well. - [[_.book.the-way-out]]



- Have medical treatments been ineffective or just given you temporary relief? 
- Did the pain come on during a stressful time in your life? 
- Do you have (or have you had) symptoms in multiple parts of your body? 
- Is your pain inconsistent in terms of where and when it appears and how severe it is? 
- Do you think about the pain often or all the time? Does it worry you throughout the day?
