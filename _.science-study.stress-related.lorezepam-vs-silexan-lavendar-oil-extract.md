**Silexan** is extract from lavender.

This study is very interesting as it shows comparable anxiety reducing results from Silexan (lavendar extract) and [[_.drug.benzodiazepine.lorazepam]] ([[_.drug.benzodiazepine]] same class as Xanax). A low dose of lorazepam was used. But nonetheless the results are quite interesting. 

> In GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) silexan and [[_.drug.benzodiazepine.lorazepam]] **showed comparable HAMA total score reductions**.   

However, a thing to note that the dosage of lorazepam used in the study is much lower than what would be typically prescribed for someone with anxiety disorder. A typical prescription of [[_.drug.benzodiazepine.lorazepam]] is 2-6mg per day. While the study used 0.5mg of lorazepam. Nonetheless its an interesting piece of information to Silexan perform at the level of mini dose of [[_.drug.benzodiazepine]].

## Dosages in the Study:
- 0.5 mg lorazepam once a day
- 80 mg Silexan once a day
