> Melatonin is a hormone secreted in the brain that regulates sleep. It appears to be highly sensitive to Light Therapy and Dark Therapy. Oral ingestion of melatonin may be used as a sleep aid. It is non-addictive. - [examine.com](https://examine.com/supplements/melatonin/)

## Motivation
<details>
<summary> My Motivation to consider to start taking</summary>

- Had great sleep with that correlated with small dose of Melatonin without feel groggy which is more alike the dose of 3mg. 
- [[_.life-force]] [[_.life-force.supplements.Peak-Rest]] supplement has 0.3mg Melatonin in it.
- As well as more interestingly [[p.Bryan-Johnson]] takes 0.3mg of Melatonin as well at night. - [blueprint ref](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co/#step-2-supplements) (However Bryan takes a myriad of things so not too surprising).

## Dosage
Our bodies produce less than 1mg of Melatonin per day. Hence, typical pharmacy dose in US is very much over-dosed as it typically starts with 3mg for smallest dose of over the counter purchases. 

## My Concern with taking it
<details>
<summary>Concern: Dopamine decrease?</summary>

[[_.IIRC]]: [[p.Andrew-Huberman]] mentioned some concern of [[_.body-chemical.dopamine]] decrease due to Melatonin supplement.


Checking in with ChatGPT didnt produce a find on this connection.


Bard on the other hand said research is mixed:
> Some research suggests that melatonin supplements may have a positive effect on dopamine levels. For example, one study found that melatonin supplementation increased dopamine levels in the striatum, a region of the brain that is involved in movement.
> 
> However, other research has found that melatonin can have a negative effect on dopamine levels. For example, one study found that melatonin supplementation decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain that is involved in decision-making and planning.
> 
> Overall, the research on the effects of melatonin on dopamine levels is mixed. More research is needed to determine the long-term effects of melatonin supplementation on dopamine levels and whether it is safe for people with dopamine-related disorders.

<summary>Concern: will other Hormones go down?</summary>

Melatonin is produced by [[_.pineal-gland]] in our body.

[[_.pineal-gland]] also produces other hormones. Will they be negatively affected?
