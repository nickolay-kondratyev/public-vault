## What is Anger
<details>
<summary>Dissonance Signal</summary>

Some tinge of Anger can illuminate dissonance, between what you are doing and what you think you should be doing. Hence, don't ignore anger. Don't try to hide it, rather evaluate WHY do you feel the way you feel. 

Anger can be taken as a signal to ACT. However, **you must not act in Anger**. 

Treat it as a cue for action, but allow your mind to return to a calm state before acting on the issue at hand. Decisions made in the heat of anger seldom lead to desired outcomes. Since at the time of anger you have blinders on not seeing the fuller picture, your mind is clouded by anger. In such state how can you establish a [[_.clear-outcome]]? And hence, if you act in anger there will be a high chance of [[_.regret]].
