Don't just act. **Act decisively** towards [[_.clear-goals]]. People can sense hesitation, what you lack can often be made up in boldness. 

Act decisively. Especially act decisively when it comes to [[_.asymmetric-risk-reward-situations]]. 

[[_.decisions.two-way-door-decisions]] should often bias us for action as well.

However, also remember [[to not rush|sc.dont.rush]], and remember that to become really successful you [[have to say no a lot|sc.th.hell-yea-or-no]].
  
![[p.Lao-Tzu.th.watch-your-thoughts-for-they-become-your-words]]

With great actions come great [[_.habits]], Remember your actions become your habits. Hence [[_.make-the-right-thing-automatic]].
