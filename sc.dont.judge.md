## Dont Judge 
**[[rel.instead.instead-of-judging]]:[[sc.do.examine-yourself]]**

![[sc.do.examine-yourself]]


> “If I am walking with two other men, each of them will serve as my teacher. I will pick out the good points of the one and imitate them, and the bad points of the other and correct them in myself.” — [[p.Confucius]]

![[p.Carl-Jung.th.Thinking is difficult__Why Most judge]]

## Another reason
We don't know what others are thinking. Hence, we often think what the other person is thinking is alike ourselves. Now, if we trained ourselves not to judge, we will feel like we aren't being judged. But if we violate this rule we will think that the other person might be judging us as well.
