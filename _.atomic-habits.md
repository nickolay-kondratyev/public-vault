I haven't read the book but my understanding of it is that we want the habits to start small. Meaning set the goals small in our habit forming process so that **we actually follow through: every time**. And gradually build upon the habit. 

The example that the author brings forth is a man who wanted to start going to the gym regularly. Instead of signing up for 1 hour classes to attend daily, and burn out. The man did the opposite for the first week he set out the goal: 

- Dress up.
- Drive to the gym.
- Walk into the gym.

And that's what he did for the first few days. Just walk into the gym and walk out. However, as time went on he said to himself well I am already here might as well work out a bit. Later a bit turned into more, and more, and more. Leading to incorporate working out and going to the gym as part of his daily routine.
