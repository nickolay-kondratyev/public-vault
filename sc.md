We all live by a set of rules, set of principles, set of codes. [[p.Ray-Dalio]] dives into this topic with his book [[_.book.principles]]

Whether they are explicit or implicit, these principles, rules, codes affect and drive our lives. Hence best to make them explicit and take control of the wheel. 

Good place to start is [[sc.almost-never.worry]], more specifically [[sc.do.laser-focus-on-what-you-control]].

Top level rules/codes are bucketed into `[DO, DONT, Avoid, Highly Avoid]`

There are also [[sc.areas]] which are specific to some part of life rather than applying globally.
