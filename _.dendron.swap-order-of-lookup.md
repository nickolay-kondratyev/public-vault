## About
There is already [scoring](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/a856347d2d935f6764c79d068db9be0b83efb10a/packages/common-all/src/fuse.ts#L321-L323) present as the first sorting.

However, when match scoring is the same this change allows the updated date to be used.

## Makes the updated date more important than levenshtein distance
```shell
cd ~/.vscode/extensions && cd $(ls -tr | grep dendron | tail -n 1)/dist && idea extension.js
```

Look for `{orderBy:e=>e.levenshteinDist,order:"asc"},{orderBy:e=>e.item.updated,order:"desc"}`
{orderBy:e=>e.levenshteinDist,order:"asc"},{orderBy:e=>e.item.updated,order:"desc"}

Swap them with `{orderBy:e=>e.item.updated,order:"desc"},{orderBy:e=>e.levenshteinDist,order:"asc"}`
{orderBy:e=>e.item.updated,order:"desc"},{orderBy:e=>e.levenshteinDist,order:"asc"}

(Reference: This is the typescript code (https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/a856347d2d935f6764c79d068db9be0b83efb10a/packages/common-all/src/fuse.ts#L330-L340) that you are modifying)
