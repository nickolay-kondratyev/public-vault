![[_.happiness.calculation-formula]]


> “The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what is in Fortune's control and abandoning what lies in yours.” — [[p.seneca]]

> “When one's expectations are reduced to zero, one really appreciates everything one does have.” — [[p.Stephen-Hawking]]

> “If you expect nothing from anybody, you’re never disappointed.” ― Sylvia Plath

> “Peace begins, when expectation ends.” — Sri Chinmoy

> “Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.” ― Alexander Pope

> “I find my life is a lot easier the lower I keep my expectations.” ― Bill Watterson

> “You are your own worst enemy. If you can learn to stop expecting impossible perfection, in yourself and others, you may find the happiness that has always eluded you.” ― Lisa Kleypas

> “When you stop expecting people to be perfect, you can like them for who they are.” — Donald Miller

> “Do not extrapolate. And nothing can happen to you. Or extrapolate. From a knowledge of all that can happen in the world.” — [[p.Marcus-Aurelius]]

> “When you let go of your expectations, when you accept life as it is, you're free.To hold on is to be serious and uptight. To let go is to lighten up.” — Richard Carlson

> ”Trade your expectations for appreciation and you will live in a beautiful state.” — [[p.Tony-Robbins]]

> "Treat what you don’t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have, the things you value most, and think of how much you’d crave them if you didn’t have them. But be careful. Don’t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them-that it would upset you to lose them."

> "It is the privilege of the gods to want nothing, and of godlike men to want little."
