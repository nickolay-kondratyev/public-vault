There have been mentions that [Chemicals in lavender and tea tree oil appear to be hormone disruptors](https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2018/chemicals-in-lavender-and-tea-tree-oil-appear-to-be-hormone-disruptors) suspecting a link between abnormal breast growth in young boysâ€”called prepubertal gynecomastia.

However, this other [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32147050/) states that there is not enough evidence of this sort of link. 

> Reporting of inclusion, demographic data, clinical data, and the potential for causality was found to be insufficient. This study did not find evidence to support the claim that tea tree essential oil is related to endocrine disruption in children, and little to no evidence to substantiate the proposed link between lavender essential oil and endocrine disruption in children. - [pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32147050/
