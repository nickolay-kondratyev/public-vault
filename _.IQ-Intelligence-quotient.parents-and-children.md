> The correlation between the IQs of parents and children is .35; between identical twins, it’s .86. - [[_.book.introduction-to-psychology-gateways-to-mind-and-behavior-e13]]

> An interesting example of some typical correlations is provided by a study that compared the IQs of adopted children with the IQs of their biological mothers. At age 4, the children’s IQs correlated .28 with their biological mothers’ IQs. By age 7, the correlation was .35. And by age 13, it had grown to .38. Over time, the IQs of adopted children become more similar to the IQs of their biological mothers. - [[_.book.introduction-to-psychology-gateways-to-mind-and-behavior-e13]]
