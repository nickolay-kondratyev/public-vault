Research suggests that BPA exposure may be associated with a variety of health issues, including reproductive disorders, heart disease, diabetes, neurological problems, and obesity.


> Bisphenol A [BPA; bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane; CAS #80-05-7] is one of the highest volume chemicals in commerce with 15-billion pounds produced per year [1], and based on the presence of BPA metabolites in urine, it can be concluded that **virtually everyone is exposed** [2], [3]. BPA has estrogenic and other endocrine disrupting activities [4], [5]. [study ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4206219/)
