## Zoom Out

<summary>Zoom out</summary>


So often the stress is due to being too zoomed in on something that is out of control and assigned too much importance. 

Look at larger span of time. Well past a day, a week or even a year.

Does being stressed create a [[habit|_.habits]] of being stressed? 

Look at 10 years. Is being so stressed out right now help or hinder your 10 year plan? 

How about 20 years? Is being perpetually stressed lead to health issues 20 years down the road? Or are you already dead due to being overly stressed? 

Hence, zoom out. And with that viewpoint re-evaluate the importance. 

[[Minimize the regret|_.mental-models.regret-minimization-framework]]

Do give it what you got. But [[don't worry|sc.almost-never.worry]].
