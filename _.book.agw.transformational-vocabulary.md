In short: When we change the words that describe situations we change how we perceive the situation. Changing the words changes our perception.

> People with impoverished vocabulary live an impoverished emotional life; people with rich vocabularies have a multi hued palette of colors with which to paint their experience, not only for others but for themselves as well.  

> Simply by changing your habitual vocabulary--the words you consistently use to describe the emotions of your life--you can instantaneously change how you think, how you feel, and how you live. 

> If you get upset you lose control. If you lose control the other guy wins.

> **Words that we attach to our experience become our experience. **

> If three people can have the same exact experience, yet one person feels rage, another feels anger, and the third feels annoyance, then obviously the sensations are being changed by each person’s translation. Since words are our primary tool for interpretation or translation, the way we label our experience immediately changes the sensations produced in our nervous systems. You and I must realize that words do indeed create a biochemical effect. 

> **Words create a biochemical effect.**

> Words form the thread on which we string our experiences

**Words shape our beliefs; They impact our actions. 
Words are the fabric from which all questions are cut.**

> Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.

> Is it possible that by adopting someone else’s habitual vocabulary, you began to adopt their emotional patterns as well? If you have adopted not only words but their volume, intensity, and tonality. (also look at [[_.book.yat]])

If an assemblage of words you’re using is creating states that disempower you, get rid of those words and replace them with those that empower you!

If all you do is change the word, then experience does not change. But if using the word causes you to break your own habitual emotional patterns, then everything changes. 

Transformational vocabulary: vocabulary that transforms our emotional experience. Breaks unresourceful patterns, makes us smile, produces totally different feelings, changes our states, and allows us to ask more intelligent questions. [[_.book.agw.quality-questions-create-quality-life]]


To soften emotional intensity even further you can use modifiers; 
* I am just a bit peeved.
* I am feeling a tad out of sorts.
* I am beginning to get a smidge cranky.

The words we use have a profound effect on our experience of reality. 

Tension in the stomach prior to performance can be interpreted as “stage fright” or as “excitement”. One is an enemy another an ally.
