Incentives matter. 

> Tell me how you measure and I will tell you how I will behave.

We are largely emotion driven creatures motivated by the forces of [[_.pain-and-pleasure]].

Hence, pay attention to incentives that you have around you. See how they influence you and whether incentives that drive you are in alignment with your clear goals ([[sc.do.have-clear-goals]]).
