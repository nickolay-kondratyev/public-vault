To really focus, [[_.start-with-the-why]] not the WHAT task you are going to finish, but WHY are you going to finish this TASK. Why is it important to finish? Visualize finishing the task and feel how good it feels when the task is finished. How do you feel when the task is finished (Have [[_.clear-outcome]] of finishing this task). 

------------------------------------------------------

While doing the task laser focus on the task at hand ([[sc.do.laser-focus-on-what-you-control]]).

ToFigureOut: However, figure out a way to make sure to see the big picture task. To prevent trying dig through rock when stepping back out and digging in another place is needed to reach the goal. Possibly 
- time box approaches.
- and make sure to re-evaluate that your approach isn't in violation of [[_.mental-models.avoid-momentum-bias--dont-dig-against-a-rock-when-well-digging]] while making sure you are in [[_.state.flow-work-state]]
