## You can be forgiven for murder, rape, genocide. But if you Blasphemy against Holy Spirit, you cannot be forgiven.
> “Truly I tell you, people will be forgiven for their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter; 29but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”— 30for they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.” - [Mark 3:28-30](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Mark%203:28%E2%80%9330&version=nrsv)
