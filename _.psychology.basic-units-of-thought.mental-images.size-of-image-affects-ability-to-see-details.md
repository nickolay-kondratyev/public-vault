> Does the “size” of a mental image affect thinking? To find out, first picture a cat sitting beside a housefly. Now try to “zoom in” on the cat’s ears so you see them clearly. Next, picture a rabbit sitting beside an elephant. How quickly can you “see” the rabbit’s front feet? Did it take longer than picturing the cat’s ears?
> When a rabbit is pictured with an elephant, the rabbit’s image must be small because the elephant is large. Using such tasks, **Stephen Kosslyn (1985) found that the smaller an image is, the harder it is to “see” its details.** To put this finding to use, try form- ing oversize images of things you want to think about. For exam- ple, to understand electricity, picture the wires as large pipes with electrons the size of golf balls moving through them; to under- stand the human ear, explore it (in your mind’s eye) like a large cave; and so forth. -- [[_.book.introduction-to-psychology-gateways-to-mind-and-behavior-e13]]
