[The Lie We Live - Alan Watts on the Illusion of Time | Timestamp:49](https://youtu.be/ogLc7M9_hR8?t=49)

> It is of tremendous use for us. To be able to look ahead in this way an to plan. There is no use in planning for a future which when you get to it, and it becomes the present: **You won't be there**. You will be living in some other future which hasn't yet arrived... You can't live at all unless you can live fully now. - [[p.Alan-Watts]]
