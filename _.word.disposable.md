## My Take on this word
It makes sense to continue to use this word for things that are meant to be used once. However, I don't think it makes sense to use this word as it is being used within financial realm. (E.g. [[_.term.disposable-income]])

I think it creates wrong connection for financial domain. The word "disposable" itself can create a misleading impression that the income is meant to be quickly discarded or wasted.

Instead of disposable income we can say "investable income".
