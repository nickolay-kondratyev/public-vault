[Wim Hof breathing tutorial by Wim Hof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzCaZQqAs9I)

There are interesting studies around Wim Hof Breathing. 

For example [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24799686/) that showed that Autonomic nervous system and the immune system can be influenced voluntarily. (Here is a [news story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp7Dm5V5x4I) related to this study).

Also to note from the same study:
> In the intervention group [Wim Hof Breathing], practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine (adrenaline) levels. - [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24799686/)

<summary>Definitions for above quote</summary>

- Respiratory alkalosis is a condition in which the pH of the blood becomes too alkaline (greater than 7.45) due to a decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood. 
- Hypoxia: the body is deprived of an adequate supply of oxygen.
- increased plasma epinephrine levels: there is a higher amount of epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) present in the blood.
