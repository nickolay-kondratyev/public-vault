- Split keyboard.

## About 
Was recommended to me by manager at the time who also previously had pain in his hands from typing and switched out multiple keyboards (including Kinesis FreeStylePro, ErgoDox) settling on lily58.

I am currently switching from KinesisFreeStylePro (with cherry 45g switches) to lily58 with 35g switches. 

I tried the initially recommended switches of 25g but they were too light for my taste, you had to hover your fingers on top of the keyboard. 

## This is what mine currently looks like

It is slowly loosing the pasted on letters to allow for nicer key caps to shine through.
