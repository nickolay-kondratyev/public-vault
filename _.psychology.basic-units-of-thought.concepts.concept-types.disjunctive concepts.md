> Disjunctive concepts have at least one of several possible features. These are “either/or” concepts. To belong to the category, an item must have “this feature or that feature or another feature.” For example, in baseball, a strike is either a swing and a miss or a pitch over the plate or a foul ball. The either/or quality of disjunctive
concepts makes them harder to learn.
