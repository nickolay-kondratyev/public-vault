## Personal Knowledge Management
I currently use [[_.dendron]]. It is a powerful tool but rough around the edges.

If you aren't a software developer, at this time I would recommend its competitor [[_.obsidian]] for long term knowledge management storage.

## MindMaps
Mind maps are great way to get better grasp of information. 

It is helpful while learning a new concept as well as taking notes as you are listening to someone else.

The tool I use is [[_.mindnode]]. However, it only works on MacOS. Hence, if you are on windows look into other tools like it. Such as [[_.xmind]]


## Memorization: Anki
For memorization of information. [[_.anki]] can be a good choice. (Can also just make your own Anki cards, out of thick paper).

## ChatGPT
And of course using ChatGPT to learn something. [[_.chatgpt]]
