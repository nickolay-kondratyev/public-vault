In macOS Mojave and later versions, screenshots show up as thumbnails in the corner of the screen before they are saved to the chosen location. This can create a slight delay before the screenshot file appears on your desktop.

You can disable this thumbnail preview to make the screenshot appear instantly on your desktop. Here's how to do it:

1. Press `Command + Shift + 5` on your keyboard to bring up the screenshot toolbar.

2. Click on "Options" in the toolbar.

3. Uncheck the box that says "Show Floating Thumbnail."

Now, your screenshots will save directly to your desktop without the delay caused by the thumbnail preview. 

Remember, disabling the floating thumbnail means you won't be able to use it to quickly mark up screenshots or drag them into another app, as this preview provides these features. However, you can still open screenshots and perform these actions in Preview or any other image editing tool.
