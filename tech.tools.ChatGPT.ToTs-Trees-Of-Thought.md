## Claims
<details>
<summary>Claims: 4% -> 74% success rate for Game of 24 while using ChatGPT-4, 1750% improvement</summary>

> Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%. - [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10601.pdf)
