The best goals aren't the goals that you have to push yourself to work towards.

But rather goals that are magnetized to you, and pull you towards them. 

Goals that you can easily be obsessed with. That are easy to make trade off decisions for. 

As to reach your goals you will need to say NO to a lot of other routes in your life.
