Importance of straightening up posture. ([short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmMkq88zYw))

Short Story: 
  - Lobster looses fight: hunches over.
  - Wins the fight: widens himself. 

Lobster runs on: [[_.body-chemical.serotonin]].
  - Wins: serotonin levels go up.
  - Looses: serotonin levels go down.

If you give low serotonin lobster, equivalent of anti-depressants, he will go fight again.
