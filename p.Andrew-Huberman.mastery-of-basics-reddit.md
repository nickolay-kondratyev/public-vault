> TL:DR: Rather than obsessing about protocols (minutes of sun or temperature of cold showers or type of magnesium), focus on the big things first. Exercise enough (both cardio and strength training); optimize sleep quality and quantity; eat a varied diet of high-quality and mostly unprocessed foods; and avoid addictive behaviors. In addition, focus on meaningful social relationships for both mental and physical health.
