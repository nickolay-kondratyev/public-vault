What doesn't make sense as much is that scientific research is often behind paywalls. Wouldn't we want a society that is informed with best data, to make the best decisions together? 

Meaning the journals require you to pay a non-negligible amount of money to just read the published research. The research is often funded with grants, often public grants. And the journals don't pay the researchers for the papers they publish. Sounds like hijacking of the process (Reminds of [[_.ncaa]])
