## Bluetooth Service:

1. **Definition**: A Bluetooth Service is a collection of data and associated behaviors that accomplish a particular function or feature on a device. For example, a heart rate monitor may have a "Heart Rate Service" for everything related to heart rate measurement.

2. **Role**: Services organize related sets of data, which are further detailed by Characteristics.

3. **Identification**: Each Service is uniquely identified by a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). Some UUIDs for common services are standardized by the Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group), so devices can recognize and use them universally.
