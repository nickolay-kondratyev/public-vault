Do **NOT** Rush. Act without rushing. Act with insistence and determination within strategy that you have established for achieving [[_.clear-goals]].

[[sc.do.incubate-your-actions-accordingly]] and with proper incubation [[sc.do.act-decisively]].

> “Nothing is more vulgar than haste.” — [[p.Ralph-Waldo-Emerson]]

> “Slow and Sure. Early enough if well. Quickly done can be quickly undone. To last an eternity requires an eternity of preparation. Only excellence counts; only achievement endures. Profound intelligence is the only foundation for immortality.Worth much costs much. The precious metals are the heaviest.” — [[_.book.art-of-worldly-wisdom]]

> “In any project, consider the entire process and the steps it requires before you begin it. Otherwise you’ll start off eagerly enough, but quit when it’s time for the gritty work.” — [[_.book.The-Enchiridion]]

> Don't underestimate the value of moderate effort consistently applied. - [[p.TheStoicEmperor]]

> Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day. Protracted and patient effort is needed to develop good character. - [[p.Heraclitus]]

## Not rushing and Pivotal Actions
Not Rushing does not mean not doing decisive, pivotal actions. It means approaching the pivotal actions in a logical way, [[with proper incubation|sc.do.incubate-your-actions-accordingly]]. It means writing out PROs/CONs of the action, it means getting PROs/CONs reviewed with the appropriate audience. It means elevating decisions from the limbic emotional system, to logical neo cortex system. It means looking at important decisions from multiple angles before commitment.


## Not Rushing into new roads

When a new road opens up do not rush into it. The grass is not always greener on the other side, avoid zeroing into past the CONs without seeing past PROs, while only looking at the PROs of the new road. Looking past the downsides of the new road is the remedy for false expectations and disappointment.
