Focus on user state rather state of your backend system. 
- Be very specific with user messaging.

Example of not being so specific:
- Chase App during phone verification: 

The phone stated
```
We have signed you into your account
```
While it should have stated
```
We are signing into your account
```
Since the web app was taking an extra 5 or more seconds to actually get the change. 

Its user state that matters not the state of the backend system that has allowed the sign in.
