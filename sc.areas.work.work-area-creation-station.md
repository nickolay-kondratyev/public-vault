> ## Study in a Specific Place
Ideally, you should study in a quiet, well-lit area free of distractions. If possible, you should also have at least one place **where you only study**. Do nothing else there: Keep magazines, MP3 players, friends, cell phones, pets, MSN Messenger, video games, puzzles, food, lovers, sports cars, elephants, pianos, televisions, Facebook, and other distractions out of the area. In this way, the habit of studying will become strongly linked with one specific place. Then, rather than trying to force yourself to study, all you have to do is go to your study area. Once there, youâ€™ll find it is relatively easy to get started. - [[_.book.introduction-to-psychology-gateways-to-mind-and-behavior-e13]]
