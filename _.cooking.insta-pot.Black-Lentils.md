## Proportions
| Lentils | Water |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1 | 1.75 |
| 0.5 | 0.875 |

Cook for **8 minutes on high pressure**


------------------------------------------------------
For the Instant Pot, use 1 ¾ cups water for every 1 cup black lentils.

For more flavor, add ¼ teaspoon salt.

Cook for 8 minutes on high pressure. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes.

There will be some water remaining in the pot. You can immediately drain the lentils in a colander, or you can let them sit in the pot to absorb the water. This will make them softer and creamier.


Cooking Instant Pot lentils for 6 minutes + natural release will yield a firmer lentil with a less creamy interior. If you're using black lentils for a cold salad and like a firmer texture, then try 6 minutes

You will find some lentil recipes that cook the lentils for a longer amount of time, but use a quick release.
