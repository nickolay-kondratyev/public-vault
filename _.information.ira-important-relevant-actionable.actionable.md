Most important part of Tim Ferris's IRA filter is the actionable filter. If the information is not actionable dont consume it. If you are talking to someone and you are interested in receiving the emotions they are giving you (). Or you have some other goal in mind that warrants listening to the information then continue. However, there is no point of listening to this otherwise. Also fine to listen enough to not be ignorant.
