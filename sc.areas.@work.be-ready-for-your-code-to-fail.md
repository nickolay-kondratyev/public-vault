When you are in a state that you aren't ready for your code to fail, this is typically a signal that you are too tired for coding.

Maybe you aren't too tired as a whole but you are tired of coding at that moment. And could very well be in violation of [[sc.areas.@work.avoid-working-when.too-tired]].

Pushing through this is very little use, since chances are just going to drive into a hole and potentially even break things, that will need to be unwound the next day. 

Hence, [[sc.dont.waste-time]] and rather take a break.
