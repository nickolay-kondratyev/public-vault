How to open note in a new tab, upon lookup?

Visual studio Code appears to only have https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46028295/how-to-pick-from-a-list-of-previously-opened-files-in-visual-studio-code most recently used out of the notes that were opened. And default behavior of dendron lookup appears to be to open notes inside the same tab, which renders View: Show All Editors By Most Recently Used useless (since it will always be the same file).
