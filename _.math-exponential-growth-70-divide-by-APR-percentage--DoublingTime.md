This is very neat formula to be able to have a better understanding of what exponential(percentage based) growth looks like. 

This formula allows you to find out the Doubling Time. Doubling time is how long it takes for initial quantity to double, for the given percentage growth. 

In other words: An easy way to know if you borrow $100 at 10% interest rate, how long it will take for $100 of debt to become $200 of debt (if you aren't paying it). 

It goes as follows:

> Take the number 70, divide it by percent growth of unit time, and that gives you the doubling time [reference](https://youtu.be/kZA9Hnp3aV4?t=91)- Dr. Albert A. Bartlett (Professor Emeritus, Department of Physics)


## Examples:
- 7% [[_.APR]]
  - 70/7 = 10
  - Means the quantity will double every 10 years.
- 10% APR:
  - 70/10 = 7. 
  - Hence, in previous example if you borrow $100 at 10% it will become $200 in 7 years. 
- 20% APR
  - 70/20 = 3.5
  - That means the quantity will double every 3.5 years.
    - Lets say you start out with $1,000 in debt at 20%
      - year-0:   $1,000
      - year-3.5: $2,000
      - year-7:   $4,000
      - year-10.5: $8,000
      - year-14: $16,000
      - year-17.5: $32,000
