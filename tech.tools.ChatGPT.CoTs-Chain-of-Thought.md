> CoT is a very popular way of prompting AI language models. In very simple terms, it’s simply asking the model to take its time to answer. - [ref](https://medium.com/@ignacio.de.gregorio.noblejas/tree-of-thoughts-f07aa4093870)

But not just take longer to process but rather to **reason**, as it goes over the steps.

CoTs example is adding to your prompt:

Without COT
> Prompt: {BrainTeaser}

With CoTs:

> Prompt: Your task is to solve this brainteaser encapsulated between quotes. **Please follow a step by step approach that reasons over every step of the process**.
> 
> "{BrainTeaser}"
