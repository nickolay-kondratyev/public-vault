Dont dig through rock just because that was the direction you have invested time into.

**Avoid momentum bias.** Just because you have invested time into something doesn't mean this is the best approach to reaching your goal. 

Starting the higher level goal to start out with is helpful in this approach. (Refer to [[_.mental-models.distillation-framework-to-find-what-is-essential]] to help with figuring out high level goal).
