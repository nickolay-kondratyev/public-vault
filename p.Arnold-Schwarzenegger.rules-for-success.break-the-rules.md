Rule establishing words: should/should not, company policy,  must/must not.

> “And of course rule number two is break the rules. We have so many rules in life about everything. I say break the rules not the law, but break the rules. It is impossible to be a maverick or a true original if you’re too well behaved and don’t want to break the rules. You have to think outside the box. That’s what I believe. After all, what is the point of being on this earth if all you want to do is be liked by everyone and avoid trouble? The only way that I ever got anyplace was by breaking some of the rules.” — Arnold Schwarzenegger (https://youtu.be/EyhOmBPtGNM?t=47)

> “Rules and limitations are fences we build around our possible actions. Outside the fence—outside our awareness—are other possible behaviors which we ignore once we accept the given limitation. The rule becomes as absolute as the sun rising the east; it is an accepted part of the world, even though it may have been established by a supervisor who accepted it based on a policy written in 1890”
