## Start IntelliJ from command line
Start IntelliJ from command line for your env variables to be picked up.

First create command line launcher in IntelliJ: `Tools->Create Command-line Launcher`


Then from terminal start IntelliJ using
```
idea
```

or if you have modified the default `idea` behavior.

```
command idea
```

Now IntelliJ that was started from command line should have your environment variables.
