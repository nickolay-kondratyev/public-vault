> Freedom is the only worthy goal in life. It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control. Stop aspiring to be anyone other than **your own best self**: for that does fall within your control. -- [[p.Epictetus]]

## Redditor's Analysis
([redditor analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/nnuz50/freedom_is_the_only_worthy_goal_in_life/)):

> All of us like to think we're free. It is rather unpleasant to think the contrary, I admit. However, Freedom is not something easy to achieve. Money can only grant you a type of "freedom", but having money does not mean you're free, just like being poor doesn't mean you aren't free. Being free is having total control over your mental state, your thoughts and your emotions. There is only one way to get to that place: by forcefully disregarding everything which isn't in your control, considering it (using reason, training and repetition) unimportant and indifferent. If you aren't in this stage yet (which I am not also) then you can't call yourself free. Why? Since everything, everyone and all circumstances which rule over what you desire are in control of your state and therefore you are enslaved by them. Also, since all of those are themselves dependent on other people and situations, you're in an even sadder place: you are a slave of slaves.

>So what should I value? The process of improving every single day of your life, making use of everything in your hands to be of more value and to gain wisdom and expand your consciousness. As I said, your happiness and serenity MUST reside in the journey, not in the outcome. Outcomes are dependent of other outcomes and are not in your power.
> 
> But what is the point of getting better for no outcome? The outcome is the process. The journey is the end, not the means. Of course we can appreciate what comes from the journey, but we must consider all of that as extra, as something which is pleasant to have but hey, if it is taken away from us, weÂ´re cool as well. If you aren't able to value only the process, you'll always be discontent and disappointed. It is just like any form of art: the making is the joy, not the end result. Consider, therefore, yourself as a statue and also as the sculptor. Your goal is to sculpt it to the best of your ability before the journey inevitably comes to an end.

> If you are able to do this, and as I said, you'll only get there by conditioning your mind through practice and repetition, you'll truly be free. You'll get to the point in which anything "bad" in life that happens fuels your mission, since you'll look how you can use it to continue your "work of art", and that's where all your joy is.
