I have a problem. I need to setup a Dependency Injection framework for my app and I want to use Google Guice. Could you brainstorm and present multiple distinct options as a Markdown table of options. Please explain your reasoning for including each option and also give each option an random id. Here's example of formatting of a line that I'd like you to generate:

Header line
```
| RandomId |  Option | Reasoning |
```

An example of {RandomId} is `as3133bn`.
