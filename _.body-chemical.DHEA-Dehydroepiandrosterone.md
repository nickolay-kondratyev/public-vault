## Use cases
> Aging. In theory, taking DHEA supplements to maintain DHEA levels could slow the aging process, possibly improving well-being, cognitive function and body composition. But so far research hasn't proved this to be true. More studies are needed to better understand whether DHEA supplementation can counteract some of the effects of aging. A small study suggested that taking DHEA supplements might improve skin hydration and firmness, and decrease aging spots in elderly adults.

> 
> Natural DHEA levels peak in early adulthood and then slowly fall as you age. [mayoclinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-dhea/art-20364199)
