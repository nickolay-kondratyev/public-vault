[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis)

Described by [[p.nick-bostrom]] states that one of the three propositions is almost certaintly true: 
- Fraction of civilizations that reach stage of being able to simulate a world is very close to zero. (For some reason no civizilization reaches such technological stage).
- Fraction of civilizations that are interested in running such simulations is very close to zero. 
- Fraction of all people with our life experience that are living within simulation is very close to one. 


In simpler terms, either civilizations never reach ability to simulate entire world, or are not interested in doing so, or we are living in a simulation. 

To further look at this. Imagine if each PlayStation is able to simulate a world and there is a Billion of such PlayStation consoles. Then the odds of NOT living in a console is 0.000000001.
