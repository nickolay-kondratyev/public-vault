> A recent [Stanford University](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(22)00474-8#) study has revealed that breath work wins for the fastest means to calm the body and mind. While meditation is a wonderfully supportive resource (and if you do it, keep at it!), many find it challenging to sit with their thoughts and often feel more anxious because of it. [[p.Shelly Boggs Life Force Coach]]


The study highlighted “Cyclic Sighing” as the most effective method. How to: 
- Inhale slowly through the nose ([[belly-breathing|_.state.stress.combatting-it.breathing-techniques.belly-diaphragmatic-breathing-throughout-the-day]]), and then take another shorter breath to fully inflate the lungs. 
- Then exhale from the mouth for as long as possible, ideally doubling the length of the out breath. 
- Repeat for 1-5 minutes. 

This same method has been mentioned by [[p.Andrew-Huberman]]. However, take note there is a video that uses [[p.Andrew-Huberman]] branding on youtube on cyclic sighing, The guy took 1 cycle of breath from the podcast and expanded it into long form. The Breath time in the video is too fast. ([video NOT to follow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN2ta7Z4d3s)).
