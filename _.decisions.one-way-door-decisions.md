One-way door decisions are decisions that are troublesome to reverse, sometimes prohibitively challenging to reverse.

Before taking action that is challenging/troublesome to reverse, incubate that decision and seek advice on the matter. 

## See decision as an egg to hatch.
When it comes to one-way door decisions: establish an incubation plan. See a one-way door decision as an egg that needs to be hatched. If its life altering must write down your plan, be explicit of what points need to be checked off prior to being able to take the final decision. 

If you strongly decide against the decision (during incubation): you can **break the incubation** egg and tear up (or better archive) your incubation plan.
 
When it comes to decisions that you are afraid to take. You can use a [[_.mental-models.forcing-function]]: Set a time limit when the decision auto hatches (you must take that action), unless the egg was broken during the incubation process. 


## Communication 
There is an old saying in Russian which translates to:

> What is written by a quill, will not be able to be chopped out by an ax.

Hence, when it comes to communication think twice prior to communicate. 

> First learn what your words mean, and then speak. - [[p.Epictetus]]

> Keep silent as much as possible, saying only what you must say, and that briefly. - [[_.book.The-Enchiridion]]
