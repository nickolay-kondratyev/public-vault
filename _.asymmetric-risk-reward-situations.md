When the risk is much less than the potential reward. As a simple example of asymmetric risk reward situation is: approaching a stranger that you find attractive of the opposite sex. 

What has helped me previously to push through self blockers is to have a massive penalty in mind that you are **willing** to execute upon yourself if you don't take the chance on Asymmetric risk reward situation.
