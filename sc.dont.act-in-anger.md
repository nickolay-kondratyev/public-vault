> Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him. - [[p.Epictetus]]

> If you want to cure anger: do not feed it, say to yourself: 'I used to be angry every day then every other day', once your reach 30 days give a sacrifice to the gods. - [[p.Epictetus]]
