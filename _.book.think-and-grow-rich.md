Book written by [[p.Napoleon-Hill]], after being recruited to write it by @Andrew-Carnegie. 


> The secret was brought to my [[p.Napoleon-Hill]] attention by [[p.Andrew-Carnegie]], more than a quarter of a century ago. The canny, lovable old Scotsman carelessly tossed it into my mind, when I was but a boy. Then he sat back in his chair, with a merry twinkle in his eyes, and watched carefully to see if I had brains enough to understand the **full significance** of what he had said to me. 
> 
> When he saw that I had grasped the idea, he asked if I would be willing to **spend twenty years or more**, preparing myself to take it to the world, to men and women who, without the secret, might go through life as failures. I said I would, and with Mr. Carnegie's cooperation, I have kept my promise.
