Besides many known health risk implications of smoking there is also the aging factor.

The study on identical twins showed that each 10 year of smoking translated to 2 years of additional perceived aging. 


From the study [Factors contributing to the facial aging of identical twins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19337100/)

> One of the strongest associations with perceived age was whether a person smoked: every 10 years of smoking was associated with a 2-year older appearance.
