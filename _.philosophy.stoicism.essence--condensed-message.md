Stoic philosophy teaches that life's true value lies in focusing on what is within your control and accepting what is not, thereby cultivating inner tranquility. It emphasizes the importance of personal virtue, emotional resilience, and understanding the nature of the world through reason, all as means to achieve a content and fulfilled life.
