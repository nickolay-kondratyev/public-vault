Easier said than done.

Past-future, future-future-past, past, future, future, future. That's the typical mind pattern of today's man.

At this point in my journey I don't often stay in the present. 

However, when I am able to stay in the present it is rather an awesome feeling.

------------------------------------------------------

I suspect [[_.meditation]] is quite helpful to stay to get better at staying in the present moment.

Live now. Act now, but [[sc.do.incubate-your-actions-accordingly]]

***Sometimes acting is just enjoying the moment.*** [[sc.do.enjoy]]

** Realize: Now is all there is.**

IF getting stuck in the high/low future possibility:
  FIRST: imagine the opposite.
  THEN: bring back to the present.

```
What do you see now? 
What do you hear now? 
What do you feel now?
```
