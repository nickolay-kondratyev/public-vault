> Disposable income, also known as [[_.word.disposable]] personal income (DPI), is the amount of money that an individual or household has to spend or save after income taxes have been deducted. - [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/disposableincome.asp)

I think this is very flawed term to use for the money you have left after you have paid your taxes. Disposable in our typical vocabulary is a word used to throw things out.

[[_.term.after-tax-income]], would be a better term for this.
