> “Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” – Naval Ravikant

> “The four noble truths:
>
> I. Suffering does exist.
> 
> II. Suffering arises from "attachment" to desires.
> 
> III. Suffering ceases when "attachment" to desire ceases.
> 
> IV. Freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the eightfold path” — [[p.Buddha]]

> “Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.” — [[p.Epictetus]]

> “Having the fewest wants, I am nearest to the gods.” — [[p.Socrates]]

> ~”Desire is: I really want X to happen. When X happens, then I’ll be happy, then I’ll be able to Y. 
Deliberate action is: I must do X. I was put here to accomplish Y. I am willing to endure Z for the sake of this.” 
— [[user.Ryan-Holiday]]
