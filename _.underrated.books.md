Books that I have read that I think are very underrated are:
- [[_.book.influence-with-integrity]]
  - I have never read another book that had such good illustrations to go along with the topics at hand. The advice on communication from this book is very solid. Not only for communication with others but for communication with yourself. 
  - On June 9 2023 this book has less than 60 ratings on Amazon.
- [[_.book.you-will-die]]
  - Walks through the beliefs that we take for granted, of what we deem to be Taboo. We take these beliefs as this has always been so, but the author masterly shows that this is not the case. 
  - I bought this book in Barnes in Nobles, but on June 9 2023 this book had less than 80 ratings on Amazon.
