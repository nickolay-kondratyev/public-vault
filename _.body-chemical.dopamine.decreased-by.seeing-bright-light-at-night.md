> Avoid viewing bright lights between 10 p.m.-4 a.m. This is essential, as it has been shown to activate a brain region called the habenula and drastically reduce the amount of circulating dopamine in your system. If you must view light at these times, make it very dim. Once in a while is okay, but donâ€™t make it a habit. (If you are a shift worker or want to know how to deal with jet lag, listen to this episode.) -- [[p.Andrew-Huberman]]
