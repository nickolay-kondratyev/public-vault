> Actually, it
isn't my story; it's about mother turkeys, and it belongs to the science of
ethology—the study of animals in their natural settings. Turkey mothers are good
mothers—loving, watchful, and protective. They spend much of their time tending,
warming, cleaning, and huddling their young beneath them; but there is something odd
about their method. Virtually all of this mothering is triggered by one thing: the "cheepcheep" sound of young turkey chicks. Other identifying features of the chicks, such as
their smell, touch, or appearance, seem to play minor roles in the mothering process. If a
chick makes the cheep-cheep noise, its mother will care for it; if not, the mother will
ignore or sometimes kill it.

> The extreme reliance of maternal turkeys upon this one sound was dramatically
illustrated by animal behaviorist M. W. Fox (1974) in his description of an experiment
involving a mother turkey and a stuffed polecat. For a mother turkey, a polecat is a
natural enemy whose approach is to be greeted with squawking, pecking, clawing rage.
Indeed, the experiments found that even a stuffed model of a polecat, when drawn by a
string to a mother turkey, received an immediate and furious attack. When, however, the
same stuffed replica carried inside it a small recorder that played the cheep-cheep sound
of baby turkeys, the mother not only accepted the oncoming polecat but gathered it underneath her. When the machine was turned off, the polecat
model again drew a vicious attack. - [[p.Robert-Cialdini]]
