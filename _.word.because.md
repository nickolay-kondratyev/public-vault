<summary>Experiment: measuring compliance for small favor</summary>


- **Reason & Because: 94% compliance.** ("Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush?")
- **Only Reason: 60% compliance.** ("Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?")
- **Only 'Because' word: 93% compliance.** ("Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?") 

> This parallel form of human automaticity is aptly demonstrated in an experiment by
social psychologist Ellen Langer and her co-workers (Langer, Blank, & Chanowitz,
1978). A well-known principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do
us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. **People simply like to have
reasons for what they do**. Langer demonstrated this unsurprising fact by asking a small
favor of people waiting in line to use a library copying machine: "Excuse me, I have
five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I'm in a rush?" The effectiveness of
this request plus-reason was nearly total: 94 percent of those asked let her skip ahead of
them in line. Compare this success rate to the results when she made the request only:
"Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine?" Under those
circumstances only 60 percent of those asked complied. At first glance, it appears that
the crucial difference between the two requests was the additional information provided
by the words **because** I'm in a rush. However, a third type of request tried by Langer
showed that this was not the case. It seems that it was not the whole series of words, but
the first one, **because**, that made the difference. Instead of including a real reason for
compliance, Langer's third type of request used the word because and then, adding
nothing new, merely restated the obvious: "Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the
Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?" The result was that once again
nearly all (93 percent) agreed, even though no real reason, no new information was
added to justify their compliance. Just as the cheep-cheep sound of turkey chicks
triggered an automatic mothering response from mother turkeys, even when it emanated
from a stuffed polecat, so the word because triggered an automatic compliance response
from Langer's subjects, even when they were given no subsequent reason to comply.[[Click, whirr|_.book.Influence.ref.Click-Whirr]].

## Notes 
#q: Are there experiments that measure the compliance application of 'because' for larger favors/more important situations than cutting in line?

## Thought
People like to have reasons for doing things. And above we have demonstration of [[_.book.Influence.ref.Click-Whirr]] being invoked when others provide us the reasons. 

With that consider inspiring **yourself** with REASONS, by starting with the WHY yourself: [[_.start-with-the-why]], not just to others but to yourself.
