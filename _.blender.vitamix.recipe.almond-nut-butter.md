## Raw way/Hardway:
4 cups raw almonds (Note this is for a larger vitamix. Might need to scale down, but size mattersgs)
- 350F - 10 minutes (exactly).
  - Half way through flip them. 
- Put them in a bowl
  - Let them cool for an hour
- Ramp up to 10.

6-7 minutes of running on 10 in vitamix.

## Ways to make easier
- Use roasted almonds
- Add flavorless oil
