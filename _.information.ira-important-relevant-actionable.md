> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence, a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. —Herbert Simon, recipient of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics

## Most importantly 
Most importantly the information must be [[_.information.ira-important-relevant-actionable.actionable]]. 


> There are many things of which a wise man might wish to be ignorant. - [[p.Ralph-Waldo-Emerson]]


> I never watch the news and have bought one single newspaper in the last five years...In five years, I haven’t had a single problem due to this selective ignorance. - [[p.tim-ferris]]

> For actionable information, I consume a maximum of one-third of
one industry magazine (Response magazine) and one business magazine (Inc.) per month, for a grand total of approximately **four hours/month**. That’s it for results-oriented
reading. - [[p.tim-ferris]]

> Lifestyle design is based on **massive action**—**output**. Increased output necessitates **decreased input**.
> 
>  Most information is time-consuming, negative, irrelevant to your goals, and outside of your influence. 
> 
> I challenge you to look at whatever you read or watched today and tell me that it wasn’t at least two of the four. - [[p.tim-ferris]]


> Develop the habit of asking yourself, “**Will I definitely use this information** for something immediate and important?” It’s not enough to use information for “something”—it needs to be immediate and important. If “no” on either count, don’t consume it. Information is useless if it is not applied to something important or if you will forget it before you have a chance to apply it. - [[p.tim-ferris]]


## How to Grasp Specific Information
```
IF task is "how-to" in nature:
  THEN: only read autobiographical accounts of “how I did it”.
    No speculators
    No wannabes 
```

> What if you need to learn to do something
your friends haven’t done? Like, say, sell a book to the world’s largest publisher as a
first-time author? Funny you should ask. There are two approaches I used:
1. I picked one book out of dozens based on reader reviews and the fact that the
authors had actually done what I wanted to do. If the task is how-to in nature, I only
read accounts that are “how I did it” and autobiographical. No speculators or
wannabes are worth the time.
2. Using the book to generate intelligent and specific questions, I contacted 10 of the top authors and agents in the world via e-mail and phone, with a response rate of 80%. **I only read the sections of the book that were relevant to immediate next steps, which took less than two hours**. To develop a template e-mail and call script took approximately four hours, and the actual e-mails and phone calls took less than an hour. This personal contact approach is not only more effective and more efficient than all-you-can-eat info buffets, it also provided me with the major league alliances and mentors necessary to sell this book. Rediscover the power of the forgotten skill called “talking.” It works. Once again, less is more. - [[p.tim-ferris]]
