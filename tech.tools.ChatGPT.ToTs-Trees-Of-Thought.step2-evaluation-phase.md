Purpose: 
- Assess feasibility and potential success of each option.
- Evaluate pros and cons. 
- Confidence levels and probabilities.


> The second phase is where the AI model objectively assesses each optionâ€™s potential success by evaluating their pros and cons, initial effort, implementation difficulty, potential challenges, and expected outcomes. The AI **assigns a probability of success and a confidence level for each option based on these factors**. [allabtai.com](https://www.allabtai.com/chatgpt-tree-of-thoughts-prompt-engineering/)
