[[_.Incentives Matter]]. The goal of corporations is to seek profits and increase stock value. Currently in USA there are prisons that are publicly traded companies (Eg. [CoreCivic Stock](https://www.google.com/search?q=CoreCivic+stock)). Hence, from their perspective the longer they hold prisoners and the more prisoners they have the more they achieve their goal of appeasing shareholders, and therefore receiving hefty bonuses in return. Rehabilitation and sensible punishments for non-violent crime come at complete odds with driving the stock price up. In this case we can see how legalized [[_.usa.politics.lobbying]] is quite problematic, when the interested party's goal is to maximize the amount of people behind bars at the cost of tax payers dollars. 

**In California a single prisoner costs over 100k a year.** Which is a mind boggling number considering we have over **2 million** prisoners/jailed folk in USA.

Even if we count that others states are much more frugal. Lets say we spend 50k on average per prisoner, per year across USA. That means are spending **100 Billion** dollars a year on throwing people behind bars into a system that is designed to more corrupt rather than rehabilitate. 

This is a glaring problem that appears we like to decouple ourselves from. Part of it must be driven from [[_.state.fear]] as being afraid of not being tough on crime. Part of it momentum. Whatever got us into this mess, what we should strive for is a system that is designed for rehabilitation, rather than designed for recidivism and retention. And it largely starts with having the right incentives in place. Which as previously discussed for profit prisons currently have completely twisted incentives. 

## Notes
Now most of us aren't going to start a movement to try to fix a political issue. Hence, why is this even worth writing or reading about. Isn't this just some negative information that isn't [[_.information.ira-important-relevant-actionable]]? Well, we can word this as:

* Relevant: It is relevant, at the least to your tax dollars. 
* Important: It is important from countries monetary policy and ethical concerns on over incarceration (especially regarding non-violent offenders)
* Actionable: Reach out to your senator and representative. [[_.tools.politics.find-your-representative]]. Write to them, Email them. You can even schedule an appointment to meet them in person (or at least their aides) to discuss your take on particular issue.
