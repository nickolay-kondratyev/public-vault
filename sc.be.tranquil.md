***Be at peace with the now.***

## Breathe Properly
![[sc.do.breathe-properly]]

## Be Frugal with your Fucks
The tranquility that comes when you become frugal with your fucks.

“The tranquility that comes when you stop caring what they say, or think, or do. Only what you do.”

## Have Low Expectations
![[sc.do.have-low-expectations]]

## If Anxious
Be tranquil. Remember no matter what you do you will die. 
What you have done will eventually dissipate.
In the grand scheme of things nothing matters.
What matters is your inner world. Don’t let the things that don’t matter affect your inner world.
