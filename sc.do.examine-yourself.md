## [[sc.dont.judge]] Instead examine yourself:


![[p.Confucius.th.turn-inward-examine-yourself__]]

Turn inward and see if you can find a similarity that you were going to judge someone on within yourself. And spend the energy addressing it. 

![[p.Marcus-Aurelius.th.Whenever you are about fault with someone__]]


![[p.Carl-Jung.th.Knowing you own darkness__]]
