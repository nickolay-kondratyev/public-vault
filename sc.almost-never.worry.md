- [[rel.instead]]:**[[sc.be.confident]]**. 
- [[rel.instead]]:**[[sc.do.take-action]]**

If you can't establish confidence and there is something that you do "need to be" [[worried|_.worry]] about, THEN [[rel.instead-be]]:**[[_.state.concerned]]** about it, and take action towards resolution rather than 'be worried' and [[sc.dont.waste-time]].

> Worry is like a rocking chair: it gives you something to do but never gets you anywhere. — Erma Bombeck

> Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment to his lifespan? — Matthew 6:27

> If the problem can be solved why worry? If the problem cannot be solved worrying will do you no good.
― Shantideva (Buddhist Monk)

> If we are able to overcome our anxieties and forge a fearless  attitude towards life, something strange and remarkable can occur—that margin of control over circumstance increases. — [[p.Robert-Greene]]

If you knew how things would turn out would you worry? The interesting part is that we actually know our future. We will die ([[sc.th.memento-mori-remember-death]]). What happens after death nobody really knows.
