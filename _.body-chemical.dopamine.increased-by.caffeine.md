> **Ingest caffeine (approximately 100-400mg)** in the form of coffee, tea or whatever form you prefer. This will cause a mild increase in dopamine but also increases the availability of dopamine receptors, so your body is more sensitive to circulating dopamine. Donâ€™t do this too close to sleep. I avoid caffeine after 2 p.m., with rare exceptions. - [[p.Andrew-Huberman.articles.how-to-manage-dopamine-to-improve-motivation-and-drive]]
