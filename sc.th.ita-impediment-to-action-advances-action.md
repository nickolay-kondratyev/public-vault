> “Impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” - [[p.Marcus-Aurelius]]

Impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way enlightens the way.

> "On the occasion of every accident that befalls you, remember to turn to yourself and inquire what power you have for turning it to use." - [[p.Epictetus]]

> “In a sense, people are our proper occupation. Our job is to do them good and put up with them. 
But when they obstruct our proper tasks, they become irrelevant to us—like sun, wind, animals. 
Our actions may be impeded by them, but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” - [[p.Marcus-Aurelius]]

> “What ought one to say then as each hardship comes? I was practicing for this, I was training for this.” - [[p.Epictetus]]

> “If you really want something. You will find a way. If you don’t you will find an excuse.” - [[p.Jim-Rohn]]

> “They buried us. They didn't know that we were seeds”

> “We have various abilities, present in all rational creatures as in the nature of rationality itself. And this is one of them. Just as nature takes every obstacle, every impediment, and works around it—turns it to its purposes, incorporates it into itself—so, too, a rational being can turn each setback into raw material and use it to achieve its goal. - [[p.Marcus-Aurelius]]

> “A lion chased me up a tree, and I greatly enjoyed the view from the top” – [[p.Confucius]]
