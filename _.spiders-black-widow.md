- 1.5% chance of life threatening symptoms for a healthy adult, from Black Widow Bite. 

> Bites usually occur by accident, for instance, when you stick your hand in a gardening glove and startle one hiding there. Females are much more likely than males to envenomate (inject venom into) humans. The venom is pretty potent â€” up to 15 times stronger than a rattlesnake's, according to National Geographic. You could actually die from a black widow bite, but it's unlikely. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499987/) looking at 23,409 cases of exposure to black widow venom found that **only 1.4 percent of patients had life-threatening symptoms while 65 percent had minor symptoms**. Young children, the elderly and people with compromised immunity are at greater risk of serious complications. - [howstuffworks.com](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/arachnids/black-widow-spider.htm)
