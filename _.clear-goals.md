Having clear goals is vital to success. 

Hyper successful people advocate for crisp goal clarity as first step before proceeding any further. 

Its not for nothing that we see the same pattern of advocating for goal clarity by the likes of [[p.Ray-Dalio]] in his [[_.book.principles.5-steps-to-get-what-you-want]] stating as his first step to have "**clear goals**". Or in [[_.book.think-and-grow-rich.six6-steps]] outlined by [[p.Napoleon-Hill]] stating as first step to have exact amount of money to acquire. Or by [[p.Arnold-Schwarzenegger]] stating [[p.Arnold-Schwarzenegger.rules-for-success.trust-yourself-figure-out-who-you-want-to-be]] 

Without having clear goals, clear desires of where we want to get to and who we want to become we are just a leaf being blown by the wind.

Be specific with your goals.

<summary>Tim Ferris way: What would excite me.</summary>

[[p.tim-ferris]] writes that asking a question “What do you want?” is not a good starting point as its too imprecise. He states that “What are my goals?” also falls short of the mark. The question he suggests is **“What would excite me?”**

> A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it... He should make this purpose his supreme duty, and should devote himself to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wonder away into ephemeral fancies, longings and imaginings. This is the road to self-control and true concentration of thought. -  [[rel.from]]:[[_.book.As-a-Man-Thinketh]] by [[p.James-Allen]]
