> Viewing early morning sunlight for 10-30 minutes daily. (Don’t wear sunglasses for this, **and don’t stare at the sun**; eyeglasses and contacts are acceptable). This causes the release of dopamine. If done consistently, it will also increase levels of gene expression for certain dopamine receptors. If you’re up to it, take a 1-3 minute cold shower, as cold as you can safely tolerate, as well; this is known to increase baseline dopamine for hours dramatically. - [[p.Andrew-Huberman]]
